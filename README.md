Dark Knight

Welcome to "Dark Knight", a captivating 2D platformer RPG developed using Unity. This game melds the thrill of platforming with the depth of role-playing elements, wrapped in a dark fantasy theme. Players navigate complex environments, customize their characters deeply through a detailed system, and engage in dynamic combat.

Key Features

State Machine Character Control

Utilizing Unity's Animator and robust scripting, the character seamlessly transitions between states like idle, move, run, attack, stunned, dead, jump, and throw spear. This ensures fluid gameplay and responsive character interactions with the game world.

Advanced Character Statistics

Characters have 14 detailed stats influencing gameplay dynamics. Unity's flexible data management allows for easy adjustments and scaling of character abilities, enhancing player strategy and RPG customization.

Dynamic Inventory System

Players can equip items categorized into four types: swords, armor, amulets, and flasks. Special items, particularly swords, come with unique abilities that can trigger special attacks. These interactions are managed using Unity's scriptable objects to maintain modularity and scalability.

Crafting and Skill Tree

A crafting system allows players to create items essential for progress, leveraging Unity's UI system for a seamless crafting interface. The skill tree expands player abilities, implemented through a node-based system that integrates with Unity's native tools for managing complex data relationships.

Elemental Affects and Combat Dynamics

Items can imbue player attacks with elemental effects like fire, ice, or lightning, leveraging Unity’s particle system and shader capabilities for visually striking effects. Combat mechanics are designed to use Unity’s physics and collision systems for realistic interactions.

Checkpoint and Soul Systems

Progress is saved at multiple checkpoints (candelabrums), utilizing Unity's serialization for game state management. The soul system, inspired by mechanics from games like Dark Souls, uses Unity's persistent data storage to track souls collected and lost.

Rich Enemy Variety

The game features 17 types of enemies, each adding unique challenges. From AI behaviors for skeletons to complex boss phases, Unity’s AI and pathfinding tools are used to create distinct and challenging encounters.

Sound and Music

Unity’s audio system is used to manage extensive sound effects and musical scores that enhance the atmospheric depth of the game.
